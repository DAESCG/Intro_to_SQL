Introductory Code used on 10-22-2015

This exercise is designed to be extremely basic.  SQL databases are much more complex then demonstrated here, however, the commands principles discussed here do not change.  Here we will work with sqlite (https://www.sqlite.org/) but keep in mind there are many other flavors of SQL out there on the web.
